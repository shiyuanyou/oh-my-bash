# 1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone git://github.com/ohmybash/oh-my-bash.git ~/.oh-my-bash
```

# 2. *Optionally*, backup your existing `~/.bashrc` file:

```shell
cp ~/.bashrc ~/.bashrc.orig
```

# 3. Create a new sh configuration file

You can create a new sh config file by copying the template that we have included for you.

```shell
cp ~/.oh-my-bash/templates/bashrc.osh-template ~/.bashrc
```

# 4. Reload your .bashrc

```shell
source ~/.bashrc
```

# 5. Initialize your new bash configuration

Once you open up a new terminal window, it should load sh with Oh My Bash's configuration.
